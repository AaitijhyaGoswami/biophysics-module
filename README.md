# Computational Modeling of Bacterial Colony Growth  
*DFOC Research Project (IISc)*

## Overview
This project develops a modular, simulation-driven framework for modeling bacterial population dynamics in 2D environments. Using a combination of deterministic growth models and spatially explicit grid-based simulations, the project aims to reproduce key emergent behaviors of microbial colonies such as exponential growth, nutrient-driven saturation, and diffusion-limited pattern formation.

The project serves as a foundation for beginners in computational biophysics, scientific modeling, and Python-based simulation design.

## Objectives
- Implement classical bacterial growth models (exponential, logistic, Monod).
- Develop a 2D grid-based simulation of colony expansion.
- Integrate nutrient diffusion using finite-difference approximations.
- Visualize colony morphology over time using Python tools.
- Build a modular pipeline enabling future extensions such as:
  - Antibiotic diffusion
  - Multi-strain interactions
  - Stochastic noise models

## Features (Planned)
- **Growth models:** Deterministic and stochastic formulations  
- **Spatial simulation:** Cellular automata / agent-based modeling  
- **Nutrient field:** Reaction–diffusion grid with tunable parameters  
- **Visualization:** Time-lapse rendering of colony morphology  
- **Parameter sweeps:** Automated runs across initial conditions
